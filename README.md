# Simple Python Program to Split GIFs for Steam Workshop Profile Customization

This Python program splits a GIF vertically into 5 separate GIFs. It's mainly designed for **Steam Workshop Profile Customization**.

## Instructions

1. **Run the Python program** to split your GIF into 5 separate GIFs.
2. **Upload the GIFs** to the "Upload Artwork" menu on Steam using a browser.
3. **Before submitting** the GIFs, open the browser's developer console and enter the following code:

    ```javascript
    $J('[name=consumer_app_id]').val(480);
    $J('[name=file_type]').val(0);
    $J('[name=visibility]').val(0);
    ```

4. **Repeat the process** for all 5 GIFs.
5. Once all GIFs are uploaded, go to **Edit Profile** > **Featured Showcase** > **My Steam Workshop**, and you're all set!
